# Programming Quotes API

**Overview:** This simple project uses GET & POST route handlers to populate 'random' quotes along with the 'full' list of quotes from the array data.js file. The intent of this project was to build a GET & POST API that allows anyone to add to the underlying data source array. 

You can try out this functionality through any API development tool (i.e.: POSTMAN).
